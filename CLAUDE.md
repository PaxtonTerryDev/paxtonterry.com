## Description: Personal Portfolio website for Paxton Terry

## Overview:

Personal portfolio website using NextJS 15 (AppRouter). Uses Shadcn for components.

## General Instructions:

- When generating new TypeScript code, please follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure all new functions and classes have JSDoc comments.
- Prefer object-oriented paradigms where appropriate.
- All code should be compatible with TypeScript 5.0 and Node.js 18+.

## Coding Style:

- Do not use emojis at all.
- Interface names should be prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IUserService`).
- Private class members should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).

## Regarding Dependencies:

- Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless the functionality would reasonably extend past 3 code modules / files.
- If a new dependency is required, please state the reason.
